Programmed a two-player game for our [university project group 3.](http://www-licence.ufr-info-p6.jussieu.fr/lmd/licence/2019/ue/LU2IN013-2020fev/) 

The goal of the project is to create a two player game using the MVC pattern, in this case we developed the board games Othello and Awele. 
We made different AI agents using different algorithms and strategies to play this game. We used algorithms like Minimax, Alpha-Beta. 

You can find the pdf form of the report in the repository.  

## How to play

You can play this game by executing the main.py file in Awele and Othello folder. 
In the main.py folder you can set what bot you want to play against or even play against your friend.
